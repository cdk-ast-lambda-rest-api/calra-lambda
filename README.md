# CDK Ast Lambda Rest API - CDK Packge (CALRA)

## A library for AWS API Gateway/Lambda Proxy Integration

CALRA allows simplified resource creation for AWS Lambda functions and Rest API resources by using decorators and setting a builder with default, common or custom values for IAM Roles, Runtimes, Timeouts, Layers, Environment values, etc.

This module provides the definition of decorators that are used for

### Installation

`calra_lambda` is available from PyPI as `calra-lambda`:

    pip install calra-lambda

You can as well rely on the [calra-example](https://https://github.com/cdk-ast-lambda-rest-api/calra-example) repository to get started.
To take full advantage of this package, installation of [calra-cdk](https://pypi.org/project/calra-cdk/) is recommended.

### Add decorators to your Lambda Handler

The decorators defined within this package are:

- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ANY are explicitly required for every handler and need to be defined with a custom path for your REST Endpoint.
- timeout will accept an integer value that will be transformed to duration in terms of seconds for a Lambda Function.
- memory_size will accept an integer value to specify the memory that will be assigned to each instance of your Lambda Function.
- name and description assign a custom string value passed as parameter to your Lambda Function's name and description.
- runtime, role, vpc. Each decorator receives a name string as identifier for a custom value defined for your stack using the [calra-cdk](https://pypi.org/project/calra-cdk/) module.
- environment, layer and security_group decorators can receive multi arguments or a list with the names of custom environment/layers/security_groups defined for your stack using the [calra-cdk](https://pypi.org/project/calra-cdk/) module.

```python
    from calra_lambda import *
    import json

    @GET('/dogs')
    @runtime('python3.11')
    @name('LBD-DOGS-GET')
    @memory_size(256)
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        response = {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': 'Hello World from /dogs!'
            })
        }
        return response
```
